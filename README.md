We are going to create a "Pac man - esque game"
the premise of the game is, you eat good food, you gain points, you eat trash, eventually you lose
I feel like this will be easy code and give us easy options for filling out the rubric requirements
Will keep track of how much good food you ate and tell you at the end
3 lives, 1 piece of trash takes a life
golden fruit- gives you all of your lives back
will need to import a config file
will be a maze
