We are going to create a "Pac man - esque game"
the premise of the game is, you eat good food, you gain points, you eat trash, eventually you lose
I feel like this will be easy code and give us easy options for filling out the rubric requirements
Will keep track of how much good food you ate and tell you at the end
3 lives, 1 piece of trash takes a life
golden fruit- gives you all of your lives back
will need to import a config file
will be a maze

Update: We decided to make the game like a dropper game where random items will drop from the top of the screen and the goal is for the player to catch the "good" items and avoid the "bad" items. The player begins with 3 hearts at the top of the screen and each time it touches a "bad" item, it will lose a heart. A heart is also lost if a "good" item touches the ground. Once all hearts are lost, the game ends. The goal is for the player to touch the "good" items and collect points at the top of the screen until the points reach a certain number or "high score". The player can move only move side to side across the screen, so the player must touch the "good" items before they fall completely.
